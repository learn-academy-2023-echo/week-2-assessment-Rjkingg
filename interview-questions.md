# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: An argument is what gets passed through a parameter. The parameter is naturally apart of the function. The argument is the action that will allow the function to properly execute.
Researched answer:A parameter is a variable in a function, while an argument is a value.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: .map() takes three predefined parameters: value
//
The one that is required is the value.
Researched answer: Value, Index and Array of the current element. Only value is required

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: map will return the array with the same number of elements, while filter will "filter" through the array until a specific requirement is met

Researched answer: .filter(): once a specific set of instructions have been followed, .filter will create a new array of elements. .map() A function will be called on each element in the array and a new array will be the result.

1. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is the proccess of going over each element until a certain requirment has been met

Researched answer: Iteration occurs until instructions are met-once met andf once achieved, the code block will no longer execute

1. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: A function provides re-usable code and performs an action, a method is used primarily on strings

Researched answer:  A function provides a set of tasks and used to divide code up in a way that is easier to read. A method performs specifc tasks on objects. Functions are independent of objects.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: Hoisting, if I had to guess involves bringing code up, to a higher part of a function, or block of code. Maybe arranging it differently in terms of location.

Researched answer: Before executing code, the interpreter moves the declaration of variables, classes and function to the top of their scope

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Component: Bits of code that can be re-used and are independent classes

2. Spread operator: The spread operator uses the syntax of ...3 dots and can be used to spread elements in either an array or object

3. React state: Much like a variable holds information, a React state is an object nuilt in React that holds data about the component

4. React props: Short from properties, "props" are parameters that allow components to be customized

5. DOM events: Events that happen at the user level- ie: the click of a mouse or filling in a form
